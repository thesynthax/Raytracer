# A new and improved Raytracer (C++ and OpenGL)

### To build and run:
- `git clone https://github.com//thesynthax/raytracer`
- Change the VERT_PATH and FRAG_PATH in main.cpp to the absolute paths of vertex.glsl and fragment.glsl.
- Build and run with `./run`

### Goals accomplished:
- Successfully Setup an OpenGL environment (hardest of them all)
- Triangle rendered (even harder, not even joking)
- Shaders setup, experimented with shaders and raymarching
- Sphere rendered without lighting
- Basic Lambertian lighting
- Diffuse, Metallic, Fuzzy, Dielectric and Emissive Materials
- Point and Directional Light added with soft and hard shadows
- Anti-aliasing
- GUI

### To be accomplished:
- Camera movement, projection math
- GUI completion
- Interaction using mouse
- Progressive Rendering
- Bloom
- Mesh rendering using triangles
- Optimizations using BVH, LoDs
